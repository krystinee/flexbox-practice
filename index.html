            <header>Hi, I'm Krystine. </header>
            <main>I am a Front End Developer who thrives on viusal storytelling and the best user experience. When I'm not working, polishing up my skills, or getting lost in entertaining movies and books, I can be found traveling, cooking, or searching for beauty in everyday life.</main>
            <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
                <p>I am from South Texas! My whole life I loved getting the opportunity to trael to other cities and states. Seeing different cultures and architecture outside of my hometown has always fascinated me. Roadtripping is the best, but not easy to drive out of the biggest state!</p>

            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p>I have always felt connected to nature. I love spending time outside with my dogs, going on walks and hikes, and sitting on my front porch on a breezy day. This appreciation has grown significantly throughout my 20's, and it is my own personal form of meditation. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p>Fun fact: I only recently learned how to cook a decent meal about a year ago. Cooking has never come natural to me and just never clicked. Until I got married and bought a home, I forced myself to get comfortable with cooking. Now... I LOVE IT!</p>
